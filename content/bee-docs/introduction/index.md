# Ethereum Swarm Bee
<!-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/master/README.md -->

Bee is the second official Ethereum Swarm implementation. This project is in very early stage and under active development.

No compatibility with the first Ethereum Swarm implementation is provided, mainly because the change in underlaying protocol from devp2p to libp2p. A bee node cannot join swarm network and vice versa.

API compatibility will be guaranteed when version 1.0 is released, but not before that.
