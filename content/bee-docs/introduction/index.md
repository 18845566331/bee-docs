# Compatibility
<!-- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethersphere/bee/master/README.md -->

Ethereum Swarm Bee is the second official Ethereum Swarm implementation. This project is in very early stage and under active development.
No compatibility with the first Ethereum Swarm implementation is provided, mainly because the change in underlying protocol from devp2p to libp2p. A Bee node cannot join first Swarm network and vice versa.

API compatibility will be guaranteed when version 1.0 is released, but not before that.

## Development status
Uploaded **content is not guaranteed to persist on the network** until storage insurance is implemented. All participating nodes should consider participation a voluntary service with no formal obligation whatsoever and should be expected to delete content at their will. Therefore, users should under no circumstances regard Swarm as safe storage until the incentive system is functional.
