Bee is not only a client you can use to earn gBZZ and form the network, it is also your entrypoint to the Swarm's unstoppable data storage and distribution system. Swarm is a distributed system designed to work with together with smart contracts to enable the development and infrastructure for full service applications running entirely on the decentralised web.

In this section we will describe all the different things you can do with Swarm.

### Upload and Download Files

Bee provides several convenient ways of uploading your data into the Swarm. Once your data has been uploaded, it will be distributed and stored by a worldwide network of p2p nodes, and made available from Swarm's [web gateways](https://gateway.ethswarm.org).
