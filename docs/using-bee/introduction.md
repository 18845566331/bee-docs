Bee is not only a client you can use to earn gBZZ and form the network, it is also your entrypoint to the Swarm's unstoppable data storage and distribution system. Swarm is a distributed system designed to work with together with smart contracts to enable the development and infrastructure for full service applications running entirely on the decentralised web.

In this section we will describe all the different things you can do with Swarm.

### Upload and Download Files

Bee provides several convenient ways to [upload your data into the Swarm](/docs/using-bee/upload-and-download). Once your data has been uploaded, it will be distributed, stored and retrievable by a worldwide network of p2p nodes, and made available from Swarm's [web gateway](https://gateway.ethswarm.org).

### Upload Whole Directories

Find out how to [upload whole directories](/docs/using-bee/upload-a-directory) at once using Bee's HTTP API.

### Host Your Website on the Decentralised Web

Swarm is an distributed international network of nodes that provides hosting for your unstoppable websites. See this guide to [hosting your website on swarm](/docs/using-bee/host-your-website)

### Sync With the Network

Watch as your uploaded data is [synced with the network](/docs/using-bee/syncing) of thousands of nodes worldwide!

### Keep Your Data Alive

Learn how to assign gBZZ to your data using postage stamps so that it remains [live on the Swarm network](/docs/using-bee/keep-your-data-alive).

### Pinning

Learn how to [pin your data](/docs/using-bee/pinning) so it remains available locally on your Bee node, and then repair the network in case your postage stamps run out, using *Global Pinning*.

### Light Nodes

When accessing the Swarm network for certain use cases a Bee might not want to take part in forwarding and storing data. Find out how to use Bee in [Light Node](/docs/using-bee/light-nodes) mode.
