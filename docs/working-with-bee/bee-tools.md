### Bee Dashboard

Our wonderful community and javascript team have teamed up to create [Bee Dashboard](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard), a graphical user interface for your Bee.

Use this tool to make sure your Bee is functioning correctly, keep an eye on cheques as they accumulate, and cash them out, withdrawal your earned gBZZ, and much more! Head to the [Github repo](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard) for more information on how to install and use *Bee Dashboard*.

### Swarm CLI

If you're comfortable with nodejs and the command line, we recommend you try interacting with your Bee using the mighty [swarm-cli](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cli). *Swarm CLI* is a javascript based companion for your Bee node that can maintain multiple identities, makes it super easy to host your websites and will allow you to interact with some of Swarm's more advanced features such as [feeds](/docs/develop-on-swarm/feeds).

Instructions on how to install and use *swarm-cli* are maintained at the [Github repository](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-dashboard).
