title: SWAP Bandwidth Accounting
id: swap
---

Underpinning Swarm is a set of accounting protocols that have been developed and prototyped during over 5 years of R&D. Your Beta Bee node contains functionality giving it the ability to keep track of bandwidth exchanges with all it's peers, issue and cache cheques using smart contracts which live on EVM compatible blockchain. Currently we are in the testing phase using the Goerli testnet. We would love for you to get involved, help us try out these incentives and maybe even earn some GBZZ!

:::info
Learn more about how SWAP and the other accounting protocols work by reading the [Book of Swarm](https://swarm-gateways.net/bzz:/latest.bookofswarm.eth/the-book-of-swarm.pdf).
:::

To enable SWAP mode, you must include configuration paramaters `--swap-enabled`, and also a valid [Goerli Testnet](https://goerli.net/) RPC endpoint. An example of this is provided at [rpc.slock.it/goerli](https://rpc.slock.it/goerli), you may sign up for a free account at [Infura](https://infura.io/) run your [own node](https://github.com/goerli/testnet).

When running your Bee node with SWAP enabled for the first time, your Bee node will deploy a 'chequebook' contract using the canonical factory contract which is deployed by Swarm. A factory is used to ensure every node is using legitimate and verifiable chequebook contracts. Once the chequebook is deployed, Bee will deposit a certain amount of GBZZ (Goerli BZZ tokens) in the chequebook contract so that it can pay other nodes in return for their services.

In order to interact with the Goerli blockchain to deploy contracts and make payments, we must fund our account with Goerli ETH (GETH), and to make payments in return for services our account must also own some Goerli BZZ (GBZZ). We can get both tokens for trial purposes from the [Swarm Goerli Faucet](https://faucet.ethswarm.org/).

To get the Ethereum address, we can simply run our Bee node with SWAP enabled and pointed at the Goerli rpc endpoint.

```sh
bee start \
	--verbosity 5 \
	--swap-enable \
	--swap-endpoint https://rpc.slock.it/goerli \
	--debug-api-enable
```

We will see the Ethereum address printed out in our logs.

```

```

Since we haven't yet funded our account, we will also see an error protesting insufficient funds.

```
Error: insufficient token for initial deposit	
```

To resolve this, navigate to the [Swarm Goerli Faucet](https://faucet.ethswarm.org/) and submit your address, ensuring it is prepended with the characters `0x` to the faucet, fill out the recaptcha (sorry ðŸ™ˆ) and wait for confirmation that your GETH and GBZZ have been dispensed.

Now, we can run our Bee node and we will start to see Bee creating and waiting for transactions to complete. Please be patient this might take a few moments!

Now our chequebook is deployed, and credited with an initial deposit of GBZZ ready to be given to reward our fellow busy Bee nodes for their services. You will also provide services, and be rewarded by your peers for services you provide for them.

Let's upload a 20mb file to the network so we can see some traffic being generated as Bee begins to push chunks into the network. In order to do this, we will pay a forwarding cost in each node that passes the chunk on.

```sh
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/tmp/test.txt bs=1m count=20
curl -F file=@/tmp/test.txt http://localhost:8082/files
```

As we have set `--verbosity 5` in our Bee configuration, we will be able to see these individual transactions being recorded on our node's internal per peer ledgers.

We also have a rich set of features to be able to query the current accounting state of your node. For example, you may query your node's current balance by send a POST request to the balances endpoint.

```sh
curl localhost:6060/chequebook/balance | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalBalance": 10000000,
  "availableBalance": 9640360
}
```

It is also possible to examine per-peer balances.

```sh
curl localhost:6062/balances | jq
```

```json
{
  "balances": [
    //...
    {
      "peer": "d0bf001e05014fa036af97f3d226bee253d2b147f540b6c2210947e5b7b409af",
      "balance": -85420
    },
    {
      "peer": "f1e2872581de18bdc68060dc8edd3aa96368eb341e915aba86b450486b105a47",
      "balance": -75990
    }
    //...
  ]
}
```

In Swarm, these per-peer balances simply represent trustful agreements between nodes. Tokens only actually change hands when a node settles a cheque. This can either be triggered manually or when a certain threshold is reached with a peer. In this case, a settlement takes place. You may view these using the settlements endpoint.

```sh
curl localhost:6062/settlements | jq
```

```json
{
  "totalreceived": 0,
  "totalsent": 359640,
  "settlements": [
    // ...
    {
      "peer": "d0bf001e05014fa036af97f3d226bee253d2b147f540b6c2210947e5b7b409af",
      "received": 0,
      "sent": 90070
    },
    {
      "peer": "f1e2872581de18bdc68060dc8edd3aa96368eb341e915aba86b450486b105a47",
      "received": 0,
      "sent": 89890
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```
