Your Bee node needs gBZZ to be able to properly interact with the network. In order to receive these, you will need to sign into our Discord and request your gBZZ test tokens from the #faucet channel using your node's Ethereum address.

Once you have determined your Ethereum address, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/wdghaQsGq5) and navigate to the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel. After you have [verified your username](https://discord.gg/tXGPdzZQaV) (and said hi! 👋 ), use our Faucet Bot to get your test tokens.

Here you must **type** (not copy paste) the following, replacing the address with your own:

```
/faucet sprinkle 0xabeeecdef123452a40f6ea9f598596ca8556bd57
```

If you have problems, please let us know by making a post in the [#faucet](https://discord.gg/kfKvmZfVfe) channel, we will do our best to provide tokens to everyone. 

Please be patient, we're keen for you to join the swarm too, and indeed you soon will! 🐝 🐝 🐝
