### [Access the Network](/docs/installation/install)

If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way, but not earn gBZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run Bee in the background on your computer for direct access.

### [Support the Network and Earn gBZZ by Running a Full Node](/docs/installation/install)

Earn [gBZZ](/) and help keep the swarm strong by running your own node. It's easy to set up your own Bee on your Raspberry Pi, cloud host or any home computer that's connected to the internet.
