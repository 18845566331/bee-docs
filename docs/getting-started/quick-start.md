Bee is a versatile piece of software that caters for a diverse array of use cases. 

### Access the Network

If you want to interact with the Bee ecosystem in a decentralised way, but not earn gBZZ by storing or forwarding chunks, simply run Bee in the background in [light node](/docs/access-the-swarm/light-node) on your laptop or desktop computer for direct access to the swarm.

[Install Bee](/docs/getting-started/install)

### Support the Network and Earn gBZZ by Running a Full Node

Earn [gBZZ](/docs/working-with-bee/cashing-out) and help keep the swarm strong by running your own **full node**. It's easy to set up your own Bee on your [Raspberry Pi](/docs/getting-started/rasp-bee-ry-pi), cloud host or any home computer that's connected to the internet. 

[Install Bee](/docs/getting-started/install)

### Run Your Own Hive of Nodes

Take it to the next level by running a whole hive of Bees. We provide tooling and monitoring for to help you manage large deployments of many Bee nodes.

<!-- ### [Help Others Access the Swarm](/docs/installation/gateway.md)

Contribute to the decentralisation of the swarm by creating your own Swarm Gateway so that users who aren't running Bee can connect to the swarm.  -->
